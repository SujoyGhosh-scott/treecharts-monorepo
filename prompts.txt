as you know i am working on this treechart lib. try understanding the full code from the context.
so if you see the packages\treecharts\src\utils\NodeDrawer.ts, it is responsible for creating the nodes,
but if you see the packages\treecharts\src\renderers folders, here we have different kinds of trees, that basically represent the same tree, but differently, giving the user wide varity to choose from. similarly i want to give more options for nodes. 
currently we can create only different shape nodes. but with this new version i want to provide more and more node options for the users. 
slowly we will implement 3 new complex node structures. starting with the node type NodeWithDescirption. 
so far we were showing a single value in the node, but with this we will show a value with description. the value font size will be normal, but with bold font weight,
and the description text will be smaller, and with maybe gray font color. and as you know a default node height and width is set, and the tree svg is drawn accodiginly, but in this case since the description can be of different length, the other calculations will also get impacted. 
and to demonstrate these kind of chart, do no use the existing tree examples, add a new tree below the all directional tree example to show tree with this kind of node. 


cool, the color got changed, but reducing the the width from 200 to 160 then i changed it to even smaller 60, but the actual cell width did not reduce. meaning the width we are providing in the node config is not actually being used. see why its happening
